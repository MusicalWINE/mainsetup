This repository will house scripts to setup WINE for music production. Other repositories in this organization, will only be for their intended program. So that means that if you want WINE to be automictcally installed, please do so from here. 

Commands:

Arch Linux: 
```curl https://gitlab.com/winemusiccreation/mainsetup/ArchLinux.sh | chmod +x ArchLinux.sh | bash ArchLinux.sh```

Other repositories shoudl work, but I mainly user Arch Linux so that's the only script I can make at the moment.
